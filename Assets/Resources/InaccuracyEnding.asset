  - 'Well, here we are at the end. '
  - For better or for worse, you managed to shape the outcome of the world and its
    future.
  - You followed your heart wherever it led you, despite what the situation called
    for.
  - This caused a chain reaction where civilizations built on your foundations were
    strange and warped.
  - At least you managed to create a historical landmark adored by all; The Straight
    Tower Of Piza!
  - Thanks for playing! Ending 1/4
