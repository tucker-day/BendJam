  dialogue:
  - 'Well, here we are at the end. '
  - You were quite the creative soul. You created what you wanted with no care for
    what was needed of you.
  - You stayed true to yourself no matter what.
  - Despite that, the townspeople were not very happy with your craftsmanship.
  - Fortunately for you, the weapons they chose to attack with happen to be your
    poorly made hunks of steel.
  - Any and all attempts at killing you are for naught as they are unable to even
    graze you.
  - Thanks for playing! Ending 2/4
